The study will be conducted in the Ottawa Valley near Birch Lake and close to the site of Atomic Energy Canada Ltd. whose support of the project is both physical and moral.

Professor Price stated that the ground receives as much as one-third of its water budget during the approximately 7 day melt period, and therefore, the event constitutes a very important happening in the forest. In addi- tion, the ability to predict run-off has human consequences, e.g., having flood control measures initiated and having lake levels ad- justed along drainage basins for hydroelectric plants. Prior to his appointment at Scarborough Col- lege, Professor Price spent many long days in Shefferville, Quebec, studying snowmelt pro- cesses in a subartic area for his doctoral thesis. Price received the Ph. D. degree in 1975 from McGill University from which he also received his M.Sc. degree. His B.Sc. degree was earned at the University of Wales. In addition to the snow melt project, Profes- sor Price is involved in the study of erosion along Scarborough bluffs with other physical geographers at the College. In parting he jokes that his biggest fear is that his project will run away without him."

Professor Moreland-Davies received an M.A. and a Ph.D. degree in Anthropology from the University of Toronto after earning her B.A. and M.A. in Fine Art. Work on her Ph.D. thesis, ""Ethnic Demand Hierarchies: Social and Economic Exchange in Kensington Mar- ket, Toronto"" was supported by Canada Council and Central Mortgage and Housing Reseach Fellowhips. March 29, 1978 In discussion with Professor Moreland-Davies about her new position, she mentioned that her interest in the Co-op Programme seemed to be a natural extension of the practical as- pects of the course she offers in Urban An- thropology; for example, she felt that field work research and methodology contribute substantially to a student's grasp of concepts. She continued with some thoughts about co- op programmes in general by observing that programmes offer students very direct career and employment opportunities. Thus, a student's costly investment in education can be actualized as a professional career within a shorter time period. Her greatest challenge will be to find suffi- cient jobs for all students enrolled in the Pro- gramme, given the presently tight economic situation. A job is not guaranteed to each stu- dent, but without the work experience, the Programme loses one of its main educational aspects. Professor Moreland-Davies insisted that in spite of rising enrolment in the Pro- gramme, the College must plan for future expansion of sub-programmes. Her fencing skills, National Fencing Champion in 1963, and perhaps even her multi-engine pilot's licence may also prove useful in her new position. Hon. Norman Cafik and Hon.

Tuesday, October 9, 1984 Volume 4 Number 5 UNDERGROUND THE VOICE OF SCARBOROUGH CAMPUS, U OF T According to Garth Corkill, he Communications Com- nissioner at SCSC, this new duplicating machine will greatly mprove the overall efficiency of this heavily subsidized and much needed service. ""Studen- ts in the past years have been frustrated,"" he remarked in a recent interview with the Un- derground. ""They don't like standing in line and they don't like seeing the 'No Copies Available' sign."" The principal cause of the inefficiency is the A.B. Dick machine which is currently in use in the Duplicating Centre. This machine has proven to be more of a liability than an asset to SCSC, breaking down at a minimum frequency of once per week, and rarely receiving same day service. ""Three years ago, Student Council married us to the A.B. Dick machine which, from their perspective, was very irresponsible,"" said Corkill. They (council) had taken out a 3 year contract at over $350 a month, which didn't include maintenance. An additional service contract was required which amounted to about $300 a month. The total cost over 3 years will be nearly $20,000 by next August when the contract runs out. výtva, odai igas Xerox 5400 on the way; Duplicating worries lessen with new Machine The other machine currently being leased is a coin-operated Xerox 4000 located just outside the Duplicating Centre.

The total cost will also be mitigated by the lower cost per copy which is paid to Xerox in addition to the cost of leasing. For the 3300, 1.5¢ would have to be sent to Xerox for every copy made. The cost per copy of the 5400 will be 1.05¢, .45¢ lower than that of the other machine. The features of the Xerox 5400 also made it attractive to Council. These include an automatic feeder, ability to make copies in both sizes (en- velope and 8/2/11 inches) and an output of 45 copies per minute. The installation of the new machine will enable council to remove the A.B. Dick machine from the Duplicating Centre, and use it as a coin-op outside the centre. The Xerox 4000 will be moved near to the SAC desk in the R-Wing. This move will inevitably, lure students away from the photocopying service offered by the Library with the appeal of lower prices and greater access to machines. Jennifer Mathieson, the Manager of the Duplicating Centre, feels that the new machine will especially be an asset during the exam period. ""The lines go all the way down. the hall at Christmas and, hopefully, this situation will be alleviated,"" she said. During this busy period, she plans to move the A.B. Dick into the Duplicating Centre with the Xerox 5400 and to transport the Xerox 4000 back to its former position outside the Centre. This will enable the staff to exercise a measure of control over what is an otherwise, hec- tic and confused time. Duplicating, according to Mathieson, is busier this year than at this time last year, averaging a little less than $100 a day. With the new addition she expects duplicating to The machine that Council had originally decided on, a average about $150 a day, which translates into 3000 copies per day.

He went on to explain that because it is so heavily subsidized by in- cidental fees, it is impossible to provide this service at 5¢ a copy and break even. This will probably mean an increase in price, ""But certainly not within the next year,"" he said. Corkill, who sees duplicating as a service which is vital to students, feels that the advan- tages to students far outweigh the costs and remarked: ""The bottom line is: duplicating is going to lose a lot more money by getting a third machine, but I am confident that we're going to be providing a much, much faster, efficient service to students-fewer line-ups and fewer breakdowns. Board of Directors Meeting see page 4 can ch Bad Hwang 193 The Stables will not die! Public awareness of The Stables was increased last week as the horses made an appearance outside the S-wing. Tony McWatt feels Ethnic awareness should be continuous; Cultural Awareness L from one intensive week of cultural activity to a format with a broader scope. ""Cultural Awareness Week should be the culmination of a year long awareness program,' stated McWatt, as he outlined his plans to increase interaction between cultural clubs and the general student population. McWatt believes that in the past, cultural groups have ten- ded to limit the promotion of their culture to group members already familiar with their cultural identity. He feels it is essential that these groups look beyond themselves toward an atmosphere of greater under- standing between group and non-group members. McWatt plans a different cultural emphasis each month. He has categorized the numerous cultural organizations into two distinct groups; Inspirational Clubs having a religious affiliation and Fine Arts Clubs dealing with facets of cultural identity. The first term will feature presentations from the In- spirational Clubs, while the spring term will focus on the Fine Arts groups. These month long periods of group awareness will culminate with a culture Bawang vider week at the beginning of March. As a former president of the Afro-Asian Caribbean Students Association (A.A.C.S.A.) and a Psychology and Economics major, McWatt feels his ex- perience in dealing with the past administration has given him significant insight into underst- anding the problems of the in- teraction between cultural groups and their relation to the general student body. A heightened sense of awareness. encompassing the whole school year, instead of a one week period, is what McWatt and the Commission see as their ultimate function. As head of the Cultural Commission, McWatt has re- introduced the Cultural Coun- cil, which is a body that meets once a month and consists of representatives from each student cultural organization. In recent years this forum, where all groups could openly interact, had not been used. This lack of adequate com- munication between the ad- cultural ministration and groups contributed to what McWatt felt was an anta- gonistic, superior-subordinate relationship. The establishment of a more equitable relationship between the commission and the cultural groups is among Mc- Watt's major priorities."

Any faculty member wishing to have a pub- lished book or paper in the display should leave their name with Marla Miller. In some cases a reprint of a journal article will be required. College gains new NSERC Fellows Two more of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council's presti- gious University Research Fellowships have been awarded to scientists who will be conducting their research at Scarborough College. They are Geologist Nicholas Eyles, who has been at Scarborough College since 1981, and Astronomer Martin Duncan, presently an NSERC post- doctoral fellow at Cornell Univer- sity, who arrives at Scarborough in July. Together with Dr. Les Cwynar, whose award was announced in Feb- ruary, they bring to three the number of fellowships at Scarborough College this year, out of a total of eight awards to the University of Toronto. The number of NSERC fellowships awarded across all Canadian universities stands at 62 this year. Dr. Eyles, who has done work on modern glaciers in Europe, the Western Cordillera, Iceland and Swit- zerland, will concentrate his studies on the depositional history of the soils in the Scarborough Bluffs area, to test his hypothesis that many of the soil units are ""subaqueous melt-out"" tills rather than ""lodgement"" tills. Purpose of the long-term project is the pro- tection and stabilization of the Scar- borough shoreline. The project is unique because of the size (more than 8 km. of shoreline are involved), steep- ness of slopes, complexity of soil units, and sensitivity of landowners to actual or potential loss. Library official opening Apr. 24 It's official. Scarborough College's spacious new library will be named the Vincent W. Bladen Library, in memory of the late emeritus professor who gave so much to the College. Professor Bladen died suddenly last November following a distinguished career as economist and teacher at the University of Toronto which spanned more than 60 years. Dr. Duncan, who did his graduate work at the University of Toronto and at Texas, will concentrate his re- search in the following areas: black hole models for quasars the dynamical structure and evo- lution of dense galactic nucleii and globular clusters as probes of galactic structures the dynamics of elliptical gala- xies, such as M87 computer-generated solutions of general relativistic collapse with the generation of gravitational radia- tion, and the gravitational lensing of quasars by intervening galaxies.

Gooch elected into Cambridge Fellowship Professor Paul Gooch has been elected into the Commonwealth Fellowship of St. John's College, Cambridge, for the academic year beginning October 1. He and his family will be spending a sabbatical year in Cambridge. His term as Chairman of the Division of Humanities ends July 1. Holders of the Commonwealth Fellowship at Cambridge are given every opportunity to participate as fully as possible in the life of the Col- lege. The Fellowship has an honorar- ium attached for the period of tenure. Other privileges include the right to dine at the Fellows' Table at the ex- pense of the College throughout the year. Professor Bladen came to Scarbo- rough College to teach after retiring in 1966 as Dean of Arts and Science at U of T. He served as an honourary lecturer without salary for the last several years in order to free re- sources to hire young people, and also donated his working library to the Col- lege. He conducted his economics class at Scarborough as usual on November 25, the day before he died. The library opening ceremonies will be held in The Meeting Place from 4 to 6 p.m. on Saturday, April 24. Repre- sentatives of all levels of government, canvassers, donors and members of the Bladen family will be special guests. Principal Joan E. Foley has invited all members of the faculty and staff to come and assist in welcoming these visitors. As well, the library will be open for all to view. Killam winners feted As a tribute to the Canada Council's 25th anniversary, James Ham, Presi- dent of the University of Toronto, and John Leyerle, Dean of the School of Graduate Studies, held a reception at the president's Rosedale residence in March to honour the University of Toronto's Killam award winners from 1968 to 1982. Among those present were three past Killam award winners from Scar- borough College: Professors J.C. Ritchie, Botany, P.W. Brumer, Chemistry and G.A.

One of the claws is slender, has fine bristles on its biting surfaces and can close very rapidly; the other claw is heavier, has large blunt teeth on its biting surfaces and closes very slowly. The closer muscles in these dimorphic claws are correspondingly differentiated: the cutter muscle has a majority of fast fibers while the crusher muscle has only slow fibers. In the larval stages, however, the claws and the closer muscles are not differentiated into cutter and crusher types but they gradually become differentiated during the juvenile stages.

Thus we have been able to produce lobsters with two symmetri- cal cutter claws by altering their environment during early development. This treatment en- hances the differentiation of fast fibers (hence producing cutter muscles) and suppresses dif- ferentiation of slow fibers possibly by use- disuse mechanisms related to activity in their motoneurons. As, each closer muscle has only two excitatory motoneurons it is possible to identify each and to study their effects on muscle fiber differentiation. In comparison to vertebrate skeletal muscle which is supplied by a large number of motoneurons, the lob- ster claw closer muscle with only two moto- neurons provides a simple system for studying the influence of the neuron on its end organ. by C.K.
